title: "Scientists closer to finding the cell of origin for ovarian cancer"
description: "In the UK, ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women, with less than a third of women being diagnosed early because symptoms are vague. Researchers at Oxford University have recently discovered six types of cell that trigger ovarian cancer using a novel technique called single cell RNA sequencing. This research will take us a step closer to identifying ovarian cancers earlier and developing new innovative tools for screening."
