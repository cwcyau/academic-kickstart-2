# Electronic health records 

Electronic health records (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs) are computer-based records of an individual's *health record*. What this precisely means depends on where you live and the type of health care system in operation or you subscribe to. 

# What goes in an electronic health record?

Broadly speaking your EHR will include the dates and times when information about health conditions, treatments or test results are entered into your record by a registered health practitioner. Much of the information is *structured* with specific options available but some modern records might also contain *free text*, medical images, genetic data, etc.

You may have more than one health record because different organisations that manage your health might maintain their own record system and they do not always contain the same information.
