A report on a patient engagement workshop series on what cancer patients think about artificial intelligence is now available. 

The workshop series was developed in partnership with [Ovarian Cancer Action](https://ovarian.org.uk/) (OCA) as part of my Turing AI Fellowship. 

I am grateful to patients and OCA for their support in developing this work and its impact on my future research plans.

The report is available to download from [here](https://github.com/cwcyau/turingaifellowship/blob/c38556ef96768a3b83744ea7c9eabe3290ffc623/mycancerai.pdf).
