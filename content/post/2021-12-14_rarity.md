title: "Rarity: Discovering rare cell populations from single-cell imaging data"
description: "We have developed a novel statistical framework for unsupervised clustering, named Rarity, that enables the discovery process for rare cell types to be more robust, consistent and interpretable. We achieve this by devising a novel clustering method based on a Bayesian latent variable model in which we assign cells to inferred latent binary on/off expression profiles. This lets us achieve increased sensitivity to rare cell populations while also allowing us to control and interpret potential false positive discoveries.  We demonstrate the utility of our methods using a number of existing and novel IMC data sets.."

Kaspar Martens will present his latest work at the NeurIPS Workshop "Learning Meaningful Representations of Life"
[Rarity: Discovering rare cell populations from single-cell imaging data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r9TINxfXgB_cs4bOcT7ZYZjF5IMcb4X6/view). The work arises from his Turing-Crick Biomedical Award which supports a collaboration between the Alan Turing Institute and the Ciccarelli Group at Kings College London and the Francis Crick Institute.
