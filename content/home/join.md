We are a decentralised group of researchers operating across institutional or disciplinary barriers. We do science to truly benefit the greater good.

We are looking for researchers who buy into this philosophy to become involved with our research activities. You can join as directly as a PhD student or postdoctoral researcher or, alternatively, you can collaborate on a less formal basis as an Affiliate or Visitor.

## Postdoctoral 

Postdoctoral opportunities are available at the University of Oxford. Please contact the Principal Investigator to enquire about availability.

## PhD

Graduate studies within the group can be supported through direct or indirect entry via the following study programmes at the University of Oxford, please see the websites for more details:

* [Big Data Institute Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/study)
* [Department for Women's & Reproductive Health](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/study/research-degrees)
* [Nuffield Department of Population Health](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/study-with-us)
* [China Scholarship Council](
https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/fees-funding-and-scholarship-search/china-scholarship-council-university-oxford-scholarships)
* [Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning (EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training)](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/modern-statistics-statistical-machine-learning)
* [Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/)

Potential applicants are encouraged to contact the Principal Investigator before making applications.

## Affiliates / Visitors

If your study programme involves external laboratory placements then we would be very interested to see how we can host and support a visit to our group. We have welcomed numerous visitors from across the world over the years. Contact the Principal Investigator for further information. 

The Alan Turing Institute provides an [Enrichment programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) that allows students to take up to a year of their PhD to be based in London at the Turing Institute. If you would like to apply for the Enrichment scheme and to work with the group during the placement then contact the Principal Investigator.
