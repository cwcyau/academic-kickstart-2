Siddharth is a visiting graduate student from Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland where he is supervised by [Harri Lahdesmaki](https://users.aalto.fi/~harrila/). Siddharth is currently working on unsupervised deep generative models for clinical data with an aim to build comprehensive models for multi-disease modelling that can analyse bio-bank data at a population-wide scale and covering data from individuals even from birth/early life until disease onset. While in Oxford he will be collaborating with [Robin Evans](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~evans/) on causal modelling and with [George Nicholson](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/george-nicholson) on UK Biobank modelling.
