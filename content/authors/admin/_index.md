I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk) in a joint position between [Nuffield Department for Women's and Reproductive Health](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/christoper-yau) and the [Nuffield Department of Population Health](https://www.npdh.ox.ac.uk/). My group is based at the [Big Data Institute](http://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk). I am also Director of the [Health Data Research-Alan Turing Institute Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/talent-training/hdr-uk-turing-phd-programme-funded-by-the-wellcome-trust/) and a recipient of the [UKRI Turing Artificial Intelligence Fellowship](https://www.ukri.org/news/new-turing-ai-fellows-to-deliver-world-class-ai-research/).

## About Me

I studied undergraduate Engineering at Cambridge where I did my masters dissertation with [Professor Andrew Blake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Blake_(scientist)) at Microsoft Research on digital image analysis. Afterwards, I joined the EPSRC-funded Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre, led by [Professor David Gavaghan](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/david.gavaghan/) in Oxford where I completed my doctoral thesis in Statistics under the supervision of [Professor Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/).

I subsequently took up [MRC Fellowship in Biomedical Informatics](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=G0701810) before joining [Imperial College London](http://www.ic.ac.uk) as a Lecturer in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics. I rejoined Oxford where I became Associate Professor in Genomic Medicine as a Principal Investigator at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk). I then became Reader and then Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Birmingham](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk) and the [University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk) before returning to Oxford.

I am a member of the [MRC Better Methods, Better Research](https://mrc.ukri.org/funding/science-areas/methodology-research/) Programme Panel (formerly the Methodology Research Panel) and the [Millenium Medal](https://mrc.ukri.org/successes/awards-recognition/) committee. I lead the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership in [Quantitative Methods, Functional Genomics and Machine Learning](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/portfolio/quantitative-methods-machine-learning-and-functional-genomics-gecip-domain-various-universities/). I am also a consultant for [Kheiron Medical Technologies](https://www.kheironmed.com/), the [Medicines & Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency) and [Singula Bio](https://singulabio.com/). I was previously on the Taskforce group for the [Academy of Medical Science FLIER programme](https://acmedsci.ac.uk/grants-and-schemes/mentoring-and-other-schemes/FLIER). 

## Research Interests

For many years, I have been interested in the development of novel statistical methods for solving a broad spectrum of biomedical problems from microscopy to genomics to mental health. Real problems inspired and underpin the methodological research I do and getting to grips with real scientific investigations and experiments grounds the research in reality. 

My approach is normally Bayesian using formal probabilistic methods. This gives methods a coherent development framework allowing for greater rigour in model evaluation.

I believe in a multi-disciplinary approach which involves working with and training not only statistical and machine learning scientists but also those from a biomedical, social science or clinical background.
